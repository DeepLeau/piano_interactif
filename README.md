# piano_interactif 🎹

This is an interactive WebGL project featuring a virtual piano experience. Click on the cubes to play the next note in a sequence, accompanied by visual effects and particle animations, inspired by Stromae's music video style. The project is hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access.
